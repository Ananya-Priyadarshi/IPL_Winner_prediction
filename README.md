# IPL_Winner_Prediction
Here is a Machine Learning Model on **Kaggle IPL Dataset** which predicts the winner of the upcoming IPL season. <BR>
It was achieved using **Random Forest**, **Neural Network Models** along with **GridSearch Cross Validation** on the dataset.<BR>
An acuuracy of **90%** was achieved by optimising parameters using CrossValidation, Dropouts and **Hyperparameter tuning**
